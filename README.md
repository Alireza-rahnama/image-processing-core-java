In this project, a thresholding image processing technique has been implemented to extract the area of interest in an input image. The technique involves setting a threshold value for pixel intensity and converting the image into a binary format based on this value. This approach enables the identification and separation of regions of the image that contain the area of interest, such as objects or shapes with a certain level of contrast or color. The project showcases the practical application of thresholding in image processing, demonstrating how it can be used to extract specific features or information from complex images. Overall, this project highlights the potential of image processing techniques in various fields such as computer vision, medical imaging, and machine learning.
