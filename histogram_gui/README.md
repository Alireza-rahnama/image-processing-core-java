# image-processing-histogram

In this project, a collection of image processing methods has been implemented, which includes Histogram, Aggressive Stretch, and Equalizer techniques. These methods aim to enhance the visual quality of images by adjusting their pixel values and distributions, resulting in better contrast, brightness, and color balance. By applying these techniques, images can be improved and made more suitable for various applications such as printing, digital publishing, or multimedia production. The project showcases the practical application of these techniques and their impact on image quality.
